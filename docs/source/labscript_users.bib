  abstract = {We propose and describe our realization of a deeply subwavelength optical lattice for ultracold neutral atoms using {$N$} resonantly Raman-coupled internal degrees of freedom. Although counterpropagating lasers with wavelength {$\lambda$} provided two-photon Raman coupling, the resultant lattice period was {$\lambda$}/2⁢{$N$}, an {$N$}-fold reduction as compared to the conventional {$\lambda$}/2 lattice period. We experimentally demonstrated this lattice built from the three {$F$}=1 Zeeman states of a 87Rb Bose-Einstein condensate, and generated a lattice with a {$\lambda$}/6=132nm period from {$\lambda$}=790nm lasers. Lastly, we show that adding an additional rf-coupling field converts this lattice into a superlattice with {$N$} wells uniformly spaced within the original {$\lambda$}/2 unit cell.},

  abstract = {We introduce multiplexed atom-cavity quantum electrodynamics with an atomic ensemble coupled to a single optical cavity mode. Multiple Raman dressing beams establish cavity-coupled spin-wave excitations with distinctive spatial profiles. Experimentally, we demonstrate the concept by observing spin-wave vacuum Rabi splittings, selective superradiance, and interference in the cavity-mediated interactions of two spin waves. We highlight that the current experimental configuration allows rapid, interchangeable cavity coupling to 4 profiles with an overlap parameter of less than 10\%, enough to demonstrate, for example, a quantum repeater network simulation in the cavity. With further improvements to the optical multiplexing setup, we infer the ability to access more than 1⁢03 independent spin-wave profiles.},

  abstract = {We present a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) based control system that has been implemented to control a strontium optical lattice clock at the National Physical Laboratory, UK. Bespoke printed circuit boards have been designed and manufactured, including an 8-channel, 16-bit digital to analog converter board with a 2 {$\mu$}s update rate and a 4-channel direct-digital synthesis board clocked at 1 GHz. Each board includes its own FPGA with 28 digital output lines available alongside the specialized analog or radio frequency outputs. The system is scalable to a large number of control lines by stacking the individual boards in a master-slave arrangement. The timing of the digital and analog outputs is based on the FPGA clock and is thus very predictable and exhibits low jitter. A particular advantage of our hardware is its large data buffers that, when combined with a pseudoclock structure, allow complex waveforms to be created. A high reliability of the system has been demonstrated during extended atomic clock frequency comparisons.},

  abstract = {Nonequilibrium interacting systems can evolve to exhibit large-scale structure and order. In two-dimensional turbulent flow, the seemingly random swirling motion of a fluid can evolve toward persistent large-scale vortices. To explain such behavior, Lars Onsager proposed a statistical hydrodynamic model based on quantized vortices. Here, we report on the experimental confirmation of Onsager's model. We dragged a grid barrier through an oblate superfluid Bose--Einstein condensate to generate nonequilibrium distributions of vortices. We observed signatures of an inverse energy cascade driven by the evaporative heating of vortices, leading to steady-state configurations characterized by negative absolute temperatures. Our results open a pathway for quantitative studies of emergent structures in interacting quantum systems driven far from equilibrium.},

  abstract = {Engineering strong interactions between quantum systems is essential for many phenomena of quantum physics and technology. Typically, strong coupling relies on short-range forces or on placing the systems in high-quality electromagnetic resonators, which restricts the range of the coupling to small distances. We used a free-space laser beam to strongly couple a collective atomic spin and a micromechanical membrane over a distance of 1 meter in a room-temperature environment. The coupling is highly tunable and allows the observation of normal-mode splitting, coherent energy exchange oscillations, two-mode thermal noise squeezing, and dissipative coupling. Our approach to engineering coherent long-distance interactions with light makes it possible to couple very different systems in a modular way, opening up a range of opportunities for quantum control and coherent feedback networks.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate an atomic rf receiver and spectrum analyzer based on thermal Rydberg atoms coupled to a planar microwave waveguide. We use an off-resonant rf heterodyne technique to achieve continuous operation for carrier frequencies ranging from dc to 20 GHz. The system achieves an intrinsic sensitivity of up to -120(2), dc coupling, 4-MHz instantaneous bandwidth, and over 80 dB of linear dynamic range. By connecting through a low-noise preamplifier, we demonstrate high-performance spectrum analysis with peak sensitivity of better than -145dBm/Hz. Attaching a standard rabbit-ears antenna, the spectrum analyzer detects weak ambient signals including FM radio, AM radio, WiFi, and bluetooth. We also demonstrate waveguide-readout of the thermal Rydberg ensemble by nondestructively probing waveguide-atom interactions. The system opens the door for small, room-temperature, ensemble-based Rydberg sensors that surpass the sensitivity, bandwidth, and precision limitations of standard rf sensors, receivers, and analyzers.},

We utilize atom-by-atom assembly for the deterministic preparation of pre-defined 2D structures of rubidium Rydberg atoms with exactly known mutual separations and selectable interaction strength. By adapting the geometry and the addressed Rydberg state, a parameter regime spanning from weak interactions to strong coupling can be accessed. We characterize the simultaneous coherent excitation of non-interacting atom clusters for the state 57D5/2 and analyze the experimental parameters and limitations. For configurations optimized for Rydberg blockade utilizing the state 87D5/2, we observe collectively enhanced Rabi oscillations.},
